// Instead of passing in just one reducer to createStore(), we can pass in multiple reducers using the combineReducers() method

// The object returned by the combineReducers is how we want our Redux store to look like, which is an object with expenses and filters properties
// The expensesReducer array will be the value on the expenses property
// The filtersReducer object will be the value on the filters property
// The expenses property is managed by the expensesReducer
// The filters property is managed by the filtersReducer
